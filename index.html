            <p class="problem">RawShare is a web app created by a group of 3 people for a school project. Its purpose is to allow users to share their food with other people in their area. The app is built based on the strong research (desk and field research, focus group, surveys and interviews) that was made on the group of people interested in food waste preventing. Thanks to collected data, we found out that people would prefer to know what type of food they can get and do not really like a surprise aspects - TooGoodToGo. In addition, they are willing to share their food with others without any extra costs.</p>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Main idea</h3>
                <p>The main idea of this app is to allow people to share their left overs with others. By using a map, user can without any problems locate a food item and send a request to the owner in order to make a booking. After that, user has to pick-up the food from the owner by scanning the QR code generated automatically for each request.</p><br>
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Design system</h3>
                <p>We all know how essential design systems are these days. First of all, it improves design process workflow and the communication between designers and developers. Secondly, it allows to keep the consistency through the whole solution. Keeping this in our mind, we also decided to create our own design system based on the components in Figma.</p><br>

                <p>As you can see on the picture below, we have three connected to each other files such as: <i>Mockups</i>, <i>Components</i> and <i>Foundation</i>. What is important, in the <i>Foundation</i> file, you can find information about colors that we decided to use, fonts, and spacing.</p><br>

                <img src="img/rawshare/rs-ds-foundation.png" class="project-item-img" alt="Rawshare's design system foundation">

                <p>The whole design system is too broad to present it in just few screens so let me present you an example based on button component</p>
                
                <img src="img/rawshare/rs-ds-components.png" class="project-item-img" alt="Rawshare's design system components">
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>The app has been divided into four main sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Main/Home Page</li>
                    <li>Booked/Shared products Page</li>
                    <li>Add new item Page</li>
                    <li>Book item Page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the first section, users are able to check food items in their area by using a map. Besides that, there is also an option to check all products in a list view, specially prepared for those who love more organised way of searching information.</p><br>
                <p>The <i>Booked/Shared</i> page contains a list of users’ requests about booking products they found attractive as well as requests from other users who would like to get some from the owner. Thanks to using a segment, users can switch between orders easily without putting any extra effort. Also, under each order, there is going to be a displayed button responsible for activating a picking-up process 20 mins before setting pick-up time.</p><br>
                <p>In the Adding new item process, users are able to set all essential information about the product including an image. At the end, they have to set information about picking-up details. Due to the fact that by default, all fields about pick-up data are going to be filled by data provided by users during the sign up process, users will not have to edit these fields if nothing has changed.</p><br>
                <p>During the Booking process, users have to choose an interesting item and click button. After that, there are going to be redirected to the kind of basket page where they can add additional items from the owner of the item they chose. Because of that, they are able to pick-up more food items at the same time. At the end, users must choose a day and time when they are able to pick-up products. If the provided data does not match to owner preferences, users are going to be information by specific message immediately.</p>

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>Last but not least, I would like to say few words about the our code. Firstly, our app is created in JavaScript (front-end), PHP (back-end) and connected to database (MySQL). Thanks to that we were able to create a full stack solution with authorisation. </p><br>
                <p>In this place, I will focus on the piece of code that gets data from the database on the Home Screen. First of all, we create a function called <code>getFoodProducts()</code> and put an authorised user’s ID from the localStorage to the variable. Then we create an object called user with this ID. After that we fetch data from the the food products.php file and send there a GET variable called action with value <code>getFoodProducts</code> by method POST and convert the user object into JSON string.</p><br>
                <p>Later, in a const data variable we get data sent from the database and display its content in HTML by using a for of loop.</p><br>
                <img src="img/rawshare/rs-code-frontend.png" class="project-item-img" alt="RawShare front-end code">
                <p>In terms of back-end, let’s check out how this code allow us to read data from database in the JavaScript. First and foremost, we need to allow to use sessions and include the database connection that is another file called <i>mysql.php</i>. After that, we check if the GET variable exists, if so, check its value. Then, we need to decode sent object as a JSON string and put it to the variable called <code>$id</code>. </p><br>
                <p>After decoding, we are able to create a query that will display all items except authorised user’s items. Now we are ready to send the request to the database and read the result by using while loop. What’s important, each result raw is put to the array called data and then data is moved to the array called response and encode. Thanks to that, the data that we got from the database is ready to read in JavaScript.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Salvatio push company is a start up which helps people in danger. User, in dangerous situation, has to tap 1-3 times the salvatio push''s device which sends information by app in his phone to closest friends. The product is reserved mostly for women, elder people and atheletes. In cooperation with Magda Polakowska, we had to improve current (at this time) design and also create new stuff to mockup.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>Before we joined to Salvatio push team, they've had already a logo and visual identity. That's why we decided to use those color in our improved version of digital prototype. The same like in logo we used this gradient as a colors for elements like top bar, navigation and call to action buttons.</p><br>
                <img src="img/salvatio/salvatio-style-tile.png" class="project-item-img" alt="style tile">

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>In mockup we had to show whole process of using this app, starting from creating an account and connecting app with device, finishing on searching people in danger and changing settings. Because not only women are in target group but also elder people we tried to keep layout and main function as simple as possible.</p><br>

                <p>Generally the main page contains information with types of messages and easy access to settings where user can change the text of messages. In navigation user can find options with where can manage close contact, map with people in danger, settings and also user profile. Regarding map, user can check there how many people responded, how muh time it will take him to go to this place and the address.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Studiz is not only a company name but also its flagship solution  mobile app prepared for students to make their life easier and cheaper. In the app, users can find hundreds of attractive discounts that will allow them to save some money. Besides discounts, the app following features such as digital Student ID used for identification, Canteen system, Library system and much more.</p>

                <h3>Design system, Pattern Library and Style Guide</h3>
                <p>Main goal of my work was to redesign a mobile app as well as a desktop web app. In order to do this in a correct way, I have created a Design System that would enable company to work more efficient. First and foremost, based on my experience from previous job and knowledge gained during my free time I have created a completely new system from scratch and allowed me to keep all design rules like colors and typography with a description  of how and when to use them. Also, system includes the whole components library and view in one place.</p><br>
                <p>Thanks to the Design System, Studiz company and its developers gained a source of truth regarding mobile app/web app design rules and components that can be followed by them anytime. When it comes to designers, they can follow design and keeping the consistency through all Studiz solutions.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Before and after</h3>
                <p>The whole mobile app got a completely new design. My main goal was not only to create a new, fresh look for the app but also improve a UX flow to make it more intuitive and self explanatory.</p><br>
                <p>Currently, the main emphasis on is a <i>Campaign</i> section which contains temporary special deals that might be the most profitable for students. Thanks to using different colors, users can easily scan them without reading a text and figure out which ones can easily help him save the biggest amount of money. Another part is a <i>Favourites</i> section (if user has any) with information about new discounts in these particular web shops. The last one is a slider with all regular discounts’ categories. Due to the fact that it is placed on the bottom of the screen, users can, without any problems, find the most interesting one</p><br>
                <img src="img/studiz/studiz-discount-page.jpg" class="project-item-img" alt="studiz wireframes">
                <p>In terms of discounts details, it has been changed as well. My idea was to keep the “discount/voucher/ticket” look so that users would know immediately what it is.</p><br>

                <p>There are a lot of details as well that cannot be seen on images like the way how search should work, animations or specific zooming map feature. All of these elements have been presented as various prototypes so developers are able to have a look and implement it to the exact solution.</p><br>
                <img src="img/studiz/studiz-provider.jpg" class="project-item-img" alt="studiz wireframes">
                <p>When it comes to a discount’s provider there is a slider that contains all discounts + another item with provider’s information. To make a flow better, I have made a one page divided by segments with two sections: discounts and information. Thanks to that users can easily switch between them anytime. Now, in discounts section there are gathered all available discounts - campaigns as well as regular ones. Moreover, provider information can be checked without being forced to slide to the last item.</p><br>

                <p>Working on Studiz cases allowed me to develop my design skills, gain new ones as well as bigger confidence in making decisions that had impact on solutions’ future. Working with other developers and designers improved my team work skills. Besides that, I learned how to organise a workflow for better communication with them and make the whole process smoother and clear.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Kunste app is a mobile application created for the most famous art museum in Aarhus. The main goal of this app is to expand museum’s digital potential. By this solution we want to allow visitor to check information about the latest exhibitions and make it possible to buy online tickets and keep them as a virtual card, especially during the pandemic time when contact with other person should be limited.</p>
            

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>Based on our research we were able to sketch some our idea of how app should look like and what options it should contain. Our sketches are taking under consideration only the mobile version, because following
                    our first idea we decided to create only a mobile version of our solution. The main
                    purpose of it is to use it in the museum while exploring the exhibitions, and no one
                    takes laptop to the exhibition tours.</p>

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>After the first part of a design process (sketching), we created a first part of our digital solution - wireframes. Thanks to that we could place elements such as navigation and sliders in the right places and decide on how the layout of the app will look like. As you can see, we decided to use a lot of white spaces. Thanks to that, we were able to further direct the user's attention to the focal point of our application yet communicate a sense of professionalism and simplicity.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>Before we went to the mockups we had had to to prepare the design that will follow the museum’s visual identity. During demanding discussions we chose font called Futura PT for headers and Lato for block of text. Also we decided to use colors that matches to museum visual identity the most. In addition, when it comes to icons, we decided to keep them in minimalistic and thin style.</p><br>

                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>Based on created wireframes and style tiles we were ready to prepare mockups of our app. Our goal was to keep the design minimalistic, however, elegant and clean that is why the first conspicuous thing is a slider with current exhibitions on the bottom of the screen and a lot of white space.</p><br>
                <p>Going further, when we choose „Exhibition” section in the menu we will be moved to the page where we can find information about current exhibitions. On each exhibition preview we can read its title and finish date.</p><br>
                <p>Also, in the „My profile” page user can open his virtual card to scan in the entrance and get a digital coffee stamp for each visit. If you collect 10 of them, you will be able to get a free coffee in the museum’s cafe.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Salvatio push company is a start up which helps people in danger. User, in dangerous situation, has to tap 1-3 times the salvatio push''s device which sends information by app in his phone to closest friends. The product is reserved mostly for women, elder people and atheletes. In cooperation with Magda Polakowska, we had to improve current (at this time) design and also create new stuff to mockup.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>Before we joined to Salvatio push team, they've had already a logo and visual identity. That's why we decided to use those color in our improved version of digital prototype. The same like in logo we used this gradient as a colors for elements like top bar, navigation and call to action buttons.</p><br>

                <p>In mockup we had to show whole process of using this app, starting from creating an account and connecting app with device, finishing on searching people in danger and changing settings. Because not only women are in target group but also elder people we tried to keep layout and main function as simple as possible.</p><br>

                <p>Generally the main page contains information with types of messages and easy access to settings where user can change the text of messages. In navigation user can find options with where can manage close contact, map with people in danger, settings and also user profile. Regarding map, user can check there how many people responded, how muh time it will take him to go to this place and the address.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">Our solution for Arla is prepared for its farmers. The solution enables farmers to fill essential information about reducing CO2 in a user friendly way. Moreover, they can find some interesting news that could help them in achieving CO2 goals set by Arla and check their progress.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Main problem</h3>
                <p>The main problem was lack of solution for Arla’s farmers which would allow them to monitor a progress in reducing CO2. Due to the fact that farmers have to fill a long form about their progress time to time, they had to be convinced to stay on the website after submitting a form as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>This first time we did not have to create our own design becuase the purpose was to following Arla CVI. In this case, we analized all details in the document, chose elements which the most suits to our solution and prepared a style tile that we followed during the creation process. </p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>The whole solution created only for desktop has five essential pages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Home - dashboard</li>
                    <li>News</li>
                    <li>Data</li>
                    <li>Form</li>
                    <li>Profile</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the <i>Home</i> page farmers can find basic information about their progress in reducing CO2 as a chart for better visualisation, easy access to continue filling the form about their reducing progress and information how many days left to submit the form and brief weather that they can expect during their work. Furthermore, they always have a quick access to the Arla’s page with all essential information about its program Arla 2050.</p><br>
                <p>In the following page, users are able to read news/articles provided by Arla. All of them are divided into five categories so they can choose one that is the most interesting for them.</p><br>
                <p>Another page is used for users’ data overview. For instance, there are statistics about their work and comparison with previous months/years. Also, further down, there can be found all significant charts with data that are related to the Arla 2050 goal. Thanks to that, farmers are kept updated about their hard work progress all the time.</p><br>
                <p>The <i>Form</i> page is one of the most essential ones in the whole solution. This is a place where farmers are able to fill the form about their work. To make it more understandable and easy to navigated, the whole form has been divided into four sections. Each section contains a specific amount of questions that users have to answer. What is the most important in this form is that farmers are able to save their answers without submitting the form any time. This feature allows them to split the work based on their preferences. In addition, implemented progress bar keeps them updated about how far they are in the form.</p><br>
                <p>Last but not least, profile page. This page contains simple settings options like choosing language, switching on/off notifications and themes. In terms of themes, our idea was to use colors from Arla colors pallet that would represents each season and adjust the design’s colors to this particular one as well as the image on the <i>Home</i> page. Moreover, rewarding system has been added in order to keep farmers using our solution. Based on their reducing CO2 progress, they are going to be rewarded by getting a new badge and increasing the milk price for 0.25 cent.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Korepetycje24 is a website created for a teacher who coaches pupils and students in math, chemisty and physic. She needed a one page website where students/pupils and their parents will be able to read about what subjects she learns, what is the price for the lesson and also have posibility to sign up for the lesson or ask a question.</p>

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>In the previous section I wrote that I had to create contact/sign up form. To do that I used PHP and becuase no one can see this code in the browser, I would like to show you it here.</p><br>
                <p>At the beginning I wrote the script which disables default form behavior. Then, I took all values written by user from each input and put into variables. After that, I downloaded data from mail.php file and put varaibles from inputs into POST variables (from PHP).</p><br>
                <img src="img/korepetycje/math-js-code.jpg" class="project-item-img" alt="korepetycje code">
                <p>Subsequently, I wrote validation in PHP and used <code>mail()</code> function to send form directly on teacher's mail. What is more, in jQuery I added visualisation of my validation in PHP. Thanks to that user will know if the form was sent or some data are invalid immidiately after click send button.

            <p class="problem">The Slepfi is a hobbyist’s project created by a passionates of good design and solutions that can make people’s life easier. The main purpose of this website is to provide a solution that will allow user to find a place to stay based on attractions around this place. The website's filters will try to search a place that matches users preferences. This prototype is just a beginning. Next step is to code the entire product.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Design system</h3>
                <p>In the shortest way we can say that design system is a set of deliverables such as reusable components, design rules and pattern library. This is an extremely helpful tool for the company and its design as well as development department.</p><br>
                
                <p>That is why we decided to create a whole prototype based on design system. Thanks to that we were able to keep the consistency and design style through all pages. Moreover, due to the fact that one of our member is a developer, we wanted to make not only our work easier but also his.</p><br>
                <p>As the fact that each design system is based on design foundation and components library and it is the same with Slepfi . The whole platform is created based on components starting from buttons and inputs, ending on cards. The example with button component shows that it is created by putting each visible element to one main component and then creating other components in different variants by hiding unnecessary elements and changing its backgrounds. This approach allows us to quick and easy component’s managing while doing some changes.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>The <i>Home</i> page contains a search bar with Slepfi recommendations for users and a list of available categories that users can choose from. Due to the fact that Slepfi platform is about traveling to and searching a perfect place to stay based on our attractions’ preferences, we were aware that search functionality is one of the most essential parts in the whole project and solution would be useless if it does not work perfectly. Users need to be able to search a place in a quick and friendly way. That is why, a search is placed on the visible place, on the home screen where user cannot miss it. Furthermore, users have an access to the search in any place on the platform due to the fact that a navigation is fixed to the top.</p><br>
                
                <p>Regarding <i>Login</i> page, besides the login form, has also a small feature that might be inspiring for users in their next adventure is a huge hero image that presents one of many interesting places with an information about them on the <i>Login</i> page.</p><br>

                <p>When users wants to check information or book a specific place, they are able to find place’s description from a host and facilities. Moreover, there is a calendar where users can choose their data of stay and click <i>Book</i> button. Due to the fact that Slepfi is a solution that enables users to find a place to stay based on attractions around this place, we implemented a map that shows what kind of attractions can be find in the area. On the bottom of the page, there is a review section that makes possible for users to make a decision about booking a stay at this place based on experience of other people.</p><br>
                <p>Also due to a lot of information and content, we wanted to balance them all. To achieve this goal we used a lot of white space. This approach allows us to create a readable, easy to navigate design that people will not have problem to use.</p><br>
                <p>Last but not least, our target group are mostly young people so we made a decision to make the tone of voice less official and formal. Thanks to that, the communication with user will be kind and warm and everyone can feel comfortable and welcome.</p><br>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Slepfi is another project that allowed me to practice my design and team work skills. While working on this project I learned that working with people who are mobile and web applications enthusiast could bring fruitful results like a lot of experience by learning from each other.</p><br>
