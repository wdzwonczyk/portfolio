            <p class="problem">RawShare is a web app created by a group of three people for a school project. Its purpose is to allow users to share their food with other people in their area. The app is built based on strong research, including desk and field research, focus groups, surveys, and interviews with people interested in preventing food waste. Thanks to the collected information and data, we came to the conclusion that people are not fond of surprise elements (such as in TooGoodToGo) and are willing to share their food with others in their area without any extra costs.</p>
            <div class="message-box">
                <p>I am exicted to announce that app's design has been updated. <a href="#rawshare2"><b>Click here</b></a> to find out more about RawShare 2.0.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Main idea</h3>
                <p>The main idea of this app is to allow people to share their leftovers with others. Using a map, the user can easily locate a food item and send a request to the owner to book it. After that, the user has to pick up the food from the owner by scanning the QR code generated automatically for each request.</p><br>
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Design system</h3>
                <p>Design systems are essential these days. They improve the design process workflow and communication between designers and developers, and they allow for consistency throughout the entire solution. Keeping this in mind, we decided to create our own design system based on the components in Figma.</p><br>

                <p>As shown in the picture below, we have three interconnected files: <i>Mockups</i>, <i>Components</i> and <i>Foundation</i>. In the <i>Foundation</i> file, you can find information about the colors, fonts, and spacing we decided to use.</p><br>

                <img src="img/rawshare/rs-ds-foundation.png" class="project-item-img" alt="Rawshare's design system foundation">

                <p>The design system is too vast to cover in just a few screens, so let's use the button component as an example.</p>
                
                <img src="img/rawshare/rs-ds-components.png" class="project-item-img" alt="Rawshare's design system components">
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>The app has been divided into four main sections:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Main/Home Page</li>
                    <li>Booked/Shared products Page</li>
                    <li>Add new item Page</li>
                    <li>Book item Page</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the first section, users can check food items in their area using a map. In addition, there is an option to check all products in a list view for those who prefer a more organized way of searching for information.</p><br>
                <p>The <i>Booked/Shared</i> page contains a list of users' requests for booking attractive products, as well as requests from other users who would like to get some from an owner. Thanks to using a segment, users can switch between orders easily without putting in any extra effort. Also, under each order, there is a button displayed for activating the pick-up process 20 minutes before the set pick-up time.</p><br>
                <p>In the <i>Adding new item</i> process, users have to choose an interesting item and click a button. After that, they will be redirected to the basket page where they can add additional items from the owner of the item they chose. This allows them to pick up more food items at the same time. Finally, users must choose a day and time when they can pick up the products. If the provided data does not match the owner's preferences, users will receive a specific message immediately.</p><br>
                <p>During the <i>Booking</i> process, users select an item and click a button, which takes them to the basket page. Here, they can add more items from the same item owner, enabling them to purchase multiple food items at once. Finally, users choose a day and time to pick up the items. If the chosen date and time don't match the owner's preferences, users receive a message notifying them.</p>

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>Lastly, I would like to say a few words about our code. Firstly, our app is created in JavaScript (front-end), PHP (back-end), and connected to a database (MySQL). Thanks to that, we were able to create a full-stack solution with authorization.</p><br>
                <p>In this place, I will focus on the piece of code that gets data from the database on the Home Screen. First of all, we create a function called <code>getFoodProducts()</code> and put an authorized user's ID from the localStorage into the variable. Then we create an object called the user with this ID. After that, we fetch data from the food products.php file and send a GET variable called action with the value <code>getFoodProducts()</code> by the method POST and convert the user object into a JSON string.</p><br>
                <p>Later, in a const data variable we get data sent from the database and display its content in HTML by using a for of loop.</p><br>
                <img src="img/rawshare/rs-code-frontend.png" class="project-item-img" alt="RawShare front-end code">
                <p>Let's take a look at how this code allows us to retrieve data from the database in JavaScript. First and foremost, we need to enable sessions and include the database connection, which is located in another file called <i>mysql.php</i>. After that, we check if the GET variable exists and, if so, we check its value. We then decode the sent object as a JSON string and assign it to a variable named <code>$id</code>.</p><br>

                <p>Once we have decoded the data, we can create a query that will display all items except those belonging to authorized users. We are now ready to send the request to the database and read the results using a while loop. It's important to note that each result row is added to an array called "data," which is then transferred to the "response" array and encoded. This ensures that the data we receive from the database can be easily read in JavaScript.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3 id="rawshare2">RawShare 2.0</h3>
                <p>Since the project hand-in, the app's design and the entire design system have been updated. Thanks to these changes, the app can now provide our users with an even better experience. With a sleek and modern interface, improved navigation, and new features, the RawShare app offers a seamless and intuitive user journey.</p><br>

                <h3>Design system 2.0</h3>
                <p>The RawShare design system has been rebuilt from scratch once again. The biggest change is the way in which all foundation information is displayed. Currently, the information is shown and structured in a user-friendly manner for both designers and developers.</p><br>

                <h3>Mockups 2.0</h3>
                <p>Similar to the Design System and Components Library, the mockups have undergone an overhaul as well. All of them have been created from scratch once again, and their structure has been improved for better usability. In addition to the structural aspect, the mockups have a new look. Thanks to design changes and improvements, the app now looks cleaner, more modern, and minimalistic, while maintaining its main functionalities and flow, providing the best user experience.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Salvatio push company is a start up which helps people in danger. User, in dangerous situation, has to tap 1-3 times the salvatio push''s device which sends information by app in his phone to closest friends. The product is reserved mostly for women, elder people and atheletes. In cooperation with Magda Polakowska, we had to improve current (at this time) design and also create new stuff to mockup.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>Before we joined to Salvatio push team, they've had already a logo and visual identity. That's why we decided to use those color in our improved version of digital prototype. The same like in logo we used this gradient as a colors for elements like top bar, navigation and call to action buttons.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>In mockup we had to show whole process of using this app, starting from creating an account and connecting app with device, finishing on searching people in danger and changing settings. Because not only women are in target group but also elder people we tried to keep layout and main function as simple as possible.</p><br>

                <p>Generally the main page contains information with types of messages and easy access to settings where user can change the text of messages. In navigation user can find options with where can manage close contact, map with people in danger, settings and also user profile. Regarding map, user can check there how many people responded, how muh time it will take him to go to this place and the address.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Studiz is not only a company name but also its flagship solution, mobile app prepared for students to make their life easier and cheaper. In the app, users can find hundreds of attractive discounts that will allow them to save some money. Besides discounts, the app has following features such as digital Student ID used for identification, Canteen system, Library system and much more.</p>
            

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Design system, Pattern Library and Style Guide</h3>
                <p>The main goal of my work was to redesign a mobile app and desktop web app. To accomplish this in the most effective way, I created a Design System that could enable the company to work more efficiently. Based on my previous job experience and knowledge gained during my free time, I created a brand new system from scratch, which allowed me to keep all design rules, such as colors and typography, with a description of when and how to use them. The system also includes the whole components library and views in one place.</p><br>
                <p>Thanks to the Design System, Studiz company and its developers now have a source of truth regarding mobile app/web app design rules and components that can be followed by them anytime. For designers, they can now maintain design consistency throughout all Studiz solutions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Before and after</h3>
                <p>I completely redesigned the mobile app with the main goal of not only creating a new, fresh look for the app but also improving the UX flow to make it more intuitive and straightforward..</p><br>
                <p>Currently, the main emphasis is on the <i>Campaign</i> section, which contains temporary special deals that are most profitable for students. Thanks to the use of different colors, users can easily scan them without reading the text and figure out which ones can help them save the most money. Another part is the <i>Favourites</i> section, which shows information about new discounts in these particular web shops. The last section is a slider with all regular discounts categories, which is placed on the bottom of the screen for easy access.</p><br>
                <img src="img/studiz/studiz-discount-page.jpg" class="project-item-img" alt="studiz wireframes">
                <p>Regarding discount details, I kept the “discount/voucher/ticket” look, so that users would immediately recognize what it is.</p><br>

                <p>There are also many other details that cannot be seen in the images, such as the search function, animations, and specific zooming map features. All of these elements have been presented as various prototypes so that developers can have a look and implement them into the exact solution.</p><br>
                <img src="img/studiz/studiz-provider.jpg" class="project-item-img" alt="studiz wireframes">
                <p>When it comes to the discount provider, there is a slider that contains all discounts and another item with the provider's information. To improve the flow, I created a one-page layout divided into segments with two sections: discounts and information. This allows users to easily switch between them at any time. All available discounts, including campaigns and regular ones, are grouped in the discounts section. Additionally, users can check provider information without having to slide to the last item.</p><br>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Working on Studiz cases helped me develop my design skills, gain new ones, and increase my confidence in making decisions that had an impact on the solutions’ future. Working with other developers and designers improved my team working skills. I learned how to organize workflows for better communication with them and make the whole process smoother and more transparent.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Kunste app is a mobile application created for the most famous art museum in Aarhus. The main goal of this app is to expand museum’s digital potential. By this solution we want to allow visitor to check information about the latest exhibitions and make it possible to buy online tickets and keep them as a virtual card, especially during the pandemic time when contact with other person should be limited.</p>
            

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Sketches</h3>
                <p>Based on our research we were able to sketch some our idea of how app should look like and what options it should contain. Our sketches are taking under consideration only the mobile version, because following
                    our first idea we decided to create only a mobile version of our solution. The main
                    purpose of it is to use it in the museum while exploring the exhibitions, and no one
                    takes laptop to the exhibition tours.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>After the first part of a design process (sketching), we created a first part of our digital solution - wireframes. Thanks to that we could place elements such as navigation and sliders in the right places and decide on how the layout of the app will look like. As you can see, we decided to use a lot of white spaces. Thanks to that, we were able to further direct the user's attention to the focal point of our application yet communicate a sense of professionalism and simplicity.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>Before we went to the mockups we had had to to prepare the design that will follow the museum’s visual identity. During demanding discussions we chose font called Futura PT for headers and Lato for block of text. Also we decided to use colors that matches to museum visual identity the most. In addition, when it comes to icons, we decided to keep them in minimalistic and thin style.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>Based on created wireframes and style tiles we were ready to prepare mockups of our app. Our goal was to keep the design minimalistic, however, elegant and clean that is why the first conspicuous thing is a slider with current exhibitions on the bottom of the screen and a lot of white space.</p><br>
                <p>Going further, when we choose „Exhibition” section in the menu we will be moved to the page where we can find information about current exhibitions. On each exhibition preview we can read its title and finish date.</p><br>
                <p>Also, in the „My profile” page user can open his virtual card to scan in the entrance and get a digital coffee stamp for each visit. If you collect 10 of them, you will be able to get a free coffee in the museum’s cafe.</p><br>

User, in dangerous situation, has to tap 1-3 times the salvatio push''s device which sends information by app in his phone to closest friends. The product is reserved mostly for women, elder people and atheletes. In cooperation with Magda Polakowska, we had to improve current (at this time) design and also create new stuff to mockup.</p>

                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>Before we joined to Salvatio push team, they've had already a logo and visual identity. That's why we decided to use those color in our improved version of digital prototype. The same like in logo we used this gradient as a colors for elements like top bar, navigation and call to action buttons.</p><br>

Because not only women are in target group but also elder people we tried to keep layout and main function as simple as possible.</p><br>

                <p>Generally the main page contains information with types of messages and easy access to settings where user can change the text of messages. In navigation user can find options with where can manage close contact, map with people in danger, settings and also user profile. Regarding map, user can check there how many people responded, how muh time it will take him to go to this place and the address.</p><br>

This solution enables farmers to provide essential information about reducing CO2 in a user-friendly way. Furthermore, they can find interesting news that could assist them in achieving the CO2 goals set by Arla and track their progress.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Main problem</h3>
                <p>The main problem was the lack of a solution for Arla’s farmers that would allow them to monitor their progress in reducing CO2. Since farmers had to fill out a long form about their progress from time to time, they had to be convinced to stay on the website after submitting a form.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Style tiles</h3>
                <p>This time, we did not have to create our own design because the purpose was to follow Arla's CVI. In this case, we analyzed all the details in the document, chose elements that suit our solution the most, and prepared a style tile that we followed during the creation process.</p><br>

                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>The entire desktop-only solution has five essential pages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Home - dashboard</li>
                    <li>News</li>

                    <li>Profile</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On the <i>Home</i> page, farmers can find basic information about their progress in reducing CO2 as a chart for better visualization, easy access to continue filling out the form about their progress, information on how many days are left to submit the form, and a brief weather report that they can expect during their work. Furthermore, they always have quick access to Arla's page with all the essential information about its Arla 2050 program.</p><br>
                <p>On the following page, users can read news/articles provided by Arla. They are divided into five categories so that users can choose the most interesting one.</p><br>
                <p>Another page is used for an overview of the users' data. For instance, there are statistics about their work and comparisons with previous months/years. Further down, all significant charts with data related to the Arla 2050 goal can be found. Thanks to that, farmers are kept updated on their hard work progress all the time.</p><br>
                <p>The <i>Form</i> page is one of the most essential ones in the whole solution. This is where farmers can fill out the form about their work. To make it more understandable and easy to navigate, the whole form has been divided into four sections. Each section contains a specific number of questions that users have to answer. The most important feature of this form is that farmers can save their answers without submitting the form at any time. This feature allows them to split the work based on their preferences. In addition, an implemented progress bar keeps them updated on how far they are in the form.</p><br>
                <p>Last but not least, the profile page contains simple settings options such as choosing a language, turning notifications and themes on/off. In terms of themes, our idea was to use colors from Arla's color palette that would represent each season and adjust the design's colors to this particular one, as well as the image on the <i>Home</i> page. Moreover, a rewarding system has been added to keep farmers using our solution. Based on their progress in reducing CO2, they will be rewarded by getting a new badge and increasing the milk price by 0.25 cents.</p><br>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>It was a great experience creating a solution for such a big company like Arla. Thanks to this project, I was able to learn how to follow already existing design rules and style and how to make a solution consistent with any other ones so users will not have a feeling of using a completely different product provided by the same company.</p><br>

            <p class="problem">The Korepetycje24 is a website created for a teacher who coaches pupils and students in math, chemisty and physic. She needed a one page website where students/pupils and their parents will be able to read about what subjects she learns, what is the price for the lesson and also have posibility to sign up for the lesson or ask a question.</p>

                <h3>Code</h3>
                <p>In the previous section I wrote that I had to create contact/sign up form. To do that I used PHP and becuase no one can see this code in the browser, I would like to show you it here.</p><br>
                <p>At the beginning I wrote the script which disables default form behavior. Then, I took all values written by user from each input and put into variables. After that, I downloaded data from mail.php file and put varaibles from inputs into POST variables (from PHP).</p><br>

                <p>Subsequently, I wrote validation in PHP and used <code>mail()</code> function to send form directly on teacher's mail. What is more, in jQuery I added visualisation of my validation in PHP. Thanks to that user will know if the form was sent or some data are invalid immidiately after click send button.

            <p class="problem">The Slepfi is a hobbyist’s project created by enthusiasts of good design and solutions that can make people’s lives easier. The main purpose of this website is to provide a solution that will allow users to find a place to stay based on attractions around the area. The website's filters will try to search for a place that matches the user's preferences. This prototype is just the beginning; the next step is to code the entire product.</p>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Design system</h3>
                <p>In short, a design system is a set of deliverables such as reusable components, design rules, and pattern libraries. This is an extremely helpful tool for the company, its design, and development departments.</p><br>
                
                <p>That's why we decided to create a whole prototype based on a design system. Thanks to that, we were able to maintain consistency and design style throughout all pages. Moreover, since one of our members is a developer, we wanted to make not only our work easier but also his.</p><br>
                <p>Each design system is based on design foundation and components library, and Slepfi is no exception. The entire platform is created based on components, starting from buttons and inputs and ending with cards. For example, the button component is created by putting each visible element into one main component and then creating other components in different variants by hiding unnecessary elements and changing their backgrounds. This approach allows us to manage components quickly and easily while making changes.</p><br>

            <div class="project-process-content">
                <h3>Mockups</h3>
                <p>The <i>Home</i> page contains a search bar with Slepfi recommendations for users and a list of available categories that users can choose from. Since Slepfi is about traveling and searching for a perfect place to stay based on our attractions’ preferences, we were aware that search functionality is one of the most essential parts of the whole project, and the solution would be useless if it did not work perfectly. Users need to be able to search for a place quickly and easily. That's why we placed the search in a visible place, on the home screen where the user cannot miss it. Furthermore, users have access to the search on any page of the platform because the navigation is fixed at the top.</p><br>
                
                <p>In addition to the login form, the <i>Login</i> page has a small feature that might inspire users on their next adventure. It features a huge hero image that presents one of many interesting places with information about them.</p><br>

                <p>When users want to check information or book a specific place, they can find the place's description from a host and facilities. Moreover, there is a calendar where users can choose their dates of stay and click the <i>Book</i> button. Since Slepfi is a solution that enables users to find a place to stay based on attractions around the area, we implemented a map that shows what kind of attractions can be found in the area. At the bottom of the page, there is a review section that allows users to make a decision about booking a stay at this place based on the experiences of other people.</p><br>
                <p>Due to a lot of information and content, we wanted to balance them all. To achieve this goal, we used a lot of white space. This approach allows us to create a readable, easy-to-navigate design that people will not have any problems using.</p><br>
                <p>Lastly, our target group is mostly young people, so we made a decision to make the tone of voice less formal and official. Thanks to that, the communication with the user will be kind, warm, and welcoming, and everyone can feel comfortable.</p><br>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Slepfi is another project that allowed me to practice my design and teamwork skills. While working on this project, I learned that working with people who are mobile and web applications enthusiasts could bring fruitful results like a lot of experience by learning from each other.</p><br>
