RawShare is a mobile app created by a team of three for a school project and developed into passion one afterwards. Its purpose is to enable users to share their food surplus within their local communities, addressing the issue of household food waste in Denmark, which totals 507,000 tonnes per year. The app was built on strong research foundations, including desk and field research, focus groups, surveys, and interviews with individuals passionate about preventing food waste. Our research revealed a user preference for a transparent sharing process without surprise elements, unlike some existing platforms.

This case study will delve into our methodology throughout the creation process, including the research part, key insights, details about the design system created for this solution, and the presentation of mockups.

## The challenge
Our challenge was to create a product that could compete with existing products on the market like TooGoodToGo and Facebook Marketplace.

## Research Methodology

![Rawshare's research](/portfolio/assets/rawshare/rs-research.jpg)

**User Interviews**: We conducted in-depth interviews with a wide spectrum of participants, including regular individuals, administrators of food-wasting groups on social media, and representatives from local restaurants and cafes. These interviews provided us with a holistic view of user behaviors and pain points.

**Focus Groups**: Organized focus group sessions allowed us to facilitate open discussions and brainstorming, uncovering collective insights and perspectives.

**Surveys**: A structured survey was distributed to a broader audience, collecting quantitative data to identify trends, preferences, and behaviors related to food waste.

**Competitor Research**: In-depth analysis of competitors and similar platforms allowed us to identify industry best practices, differentiate our solution, and adapt strategies based on market trends.

**Mind-Mapping**: Utilizing mind-mapping techniques, we visually organized and synthesized research findings, identifying patterns, connections, and potential design opportunities.

**Personas**: We developed detailed user personas to humanize our target audience, helping us make design decisions that align with their needs and motivations.

## Key insights
From our extensive research, we derived the following key insights, which informed our design process:

- **Diverse User Perspectives**: Interviews provided a multifaceted understanding of the food-waste landscape, highlighting varying motivations, challenges, and behaviors.
- **User Pain Points**: Surveys and focus groups identified common pain points, such as confusion about food disposal guidelines and the need for a centralized platform to combat food waste effectively.
- **Behavioral Trends**: Our research illuminated trends, including users' willingness to engage with a food-sharing platform and their preferences regarding UI design and functionality.
- **Persona Alignment**: User personas helped us align design decisions with specific user needs and motivations, ensuring a user-centric approach.
- **Competitive Insights**: Competitor research guided our strategic approach, allowing us to capitalize on industry best practices while introducing innovative features to differentiate our platform.

<div class="py-2 px-4 mt-4 rounded-md bg-blue-100">
  <p>This comprehensive research approach and resulting insights were instrumental in shaping our design solutions for this project. While I can't disclose specific data or sensitive details, I am more than willing to discuss the research process and insights in greater detail during an interview or meeting.</p>

## Design system

Design systems are essential for improving the design process workflow, communication between designers and developers, and maintaining consistency throughout the solution. Keeping this in mind, we created our own UI Kit which transformed into real Design System in version 2.0.

![Rawshare's design system foundation example](/portfolio/assets/rawshare/rs-ds-foundation.png)

![Rawshare's design system components example](/portfolio/assets/rawshare/rs-ds-components.png)

**Foundation File**: Contains information about the colors, fonts, and spacing used.

**Components File**: Includes reusable UI elements designed to maintain consistency.

**Mockups File**: Displays the final layouts and interactions.

## Mockups

![Example of RawShare mockups](/portfolio/assets/rawshare/rs-mockups.jpg)

The app has been divided into four main sections:

**Main/Home Page**:
  - Users can check food items in their area using a map.
  - Option to view all products in a list format.

**Booked/Shared Products Page**:
  - Contains a list of users’ requests for booking products.
  - Includes requests from others who want to get food from the owner.
  - Users can switch between orders easily.
  - Activate the pick-up process 20 minutes before the set time.

**Add New Item Page**:
  - Users choose an item to add.
  - Can select additional items from the same owner.
  - Choose a day and time for pick-up.

**Book Item Page**:
  - Users select an item and can add more items from the same owner.
  - Choose a day and time for pick-up.
  - Receive a notification if the chosen time doesn’t match the owner’s preferences.

## RawShare 1.0 - final product

## RawShare 2.0

Since the project hand-in, the app’s design and the entire design system have been updated. The app now provides users with an even better experience through a sleek and modern interface, improved navigation, new features, and enhanced accessibility. Key improvements include better color contrast, larger touch targets, and labeled navigation elements, making the app more user-friendly for everyone, including those with disabilities.

## Design system 2.0

The RawShare design system has been rebuilt from scratch once again. The biggest change is that the entire foundation is now based on Figma variables such as colors, spacing, typography, and styles like shadows and effects. This update streamlines the design process, ensuring consistency and making collaboration between designers and developers more efficient.

**Foundation Section**: Displays all fundamental information.

![Example of new Design System that presents a Component section](/portfolio/assets/rawshare/rs-ds-2-components.jpg)

**Component Section**: Adheres to native iOS components, maintaining a unique identity while following iOS design principles.

## Before and after

This section presents the transformations we have implemented to enhance the app's flow and design. These updates underscore our commitment to user-friendly design and seamless functionality. As you explore the following sections, you will see steps that we have taken to exceed user expectations based on the gathered feedback.
