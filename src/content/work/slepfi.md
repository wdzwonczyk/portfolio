The Slepfi is a hobbyist’s project created by enthusiasts of good design and solutions that can make people’s lives easier. The main purpose of this website is to provide a solution that will allow users to find a place to stay based on attractions around the area. The website's filters will try to search for a place that matches the user's preferences. This prototype is just the beginning; the next step is to code the entire product.

## Design system, Pattern Library and Style Guide

In short, a design system is a set of deliverables such as reusable components, design rules, and pattern libraries. This is an extremely helpful tool for the company, its design, and development departments.
                
That's why we decided to create a whole prototype based on a design system. Thanks to that, we were able to maintain consistency and design style throughout all pages. Moreover, since one of our members is a developer, we wanted to make not only our work easier but also his.

Each design system is based on design foundation and components library, and Slepfi is no exception. The entire platform is created based on components, starting from buttons and inputs and ending with cards. For example, the button component is created by putting each visible element into one main component and then creating other components in different variants by hiding unnecessary elements and changing their backgrounds. This approach allows us to manage components quickly and easily while making changes.

## Mockups

The *Home* page contains a search bar with Slepfi recommendations for users and a list of available categories that users can choose from. Since Slepfi is about traveling and searching for a perfect place to stay based on our attractions’ preferences, we were aware that search functionality is one of the most essential parts of the whole project, and the solution would be useless if it did not work perfectly. Users need to be able to search for a place quickly and easily. That's why we placed the search in a visible place, on the home screen where the user cannot miss it. Furthermore, users have access to the search on any page of the platform because the navigation is fixed at the top.
                
In addition to the login form, the *Login* page has a small feature that might inspire users on their next adventure. It features a huge hero image that presents one of many interesting places with information about them.

When users want to check information or book a specific place, they can find the place's description from a host and facilities. Moreover, there is a calendar where users can choose their dates of stay and click the *Book* button. Since Slepfi is a solution that enables users to find a place to stay based on attractions around the area, we implemented a map that shows what kind of attractions can be found in the area. At the bottom of the page, there is a review section that allows users to make a decision about booking a stay at this place based on the experiences of other people.

Due to a lot of information and content, we wanted to balance them all. To achieve this goal, we used a lot of white space. This approach allows us to create a readable, easy-to-navigate design that people will not have any problems using.

Lastly, our target group is mostly young people, so we made a decision to make the tone of voice less formal and official. Thanks to that, the communication with the user will be kind, warm, and welcoming, and everyone can feel comfortable.

## Conclusions

Slepfi is another project that allowed me to practice my design and teamwork skills. While working on this project, I learned that working with people who are mobile and web applications enthusiasts could bring fruitful results like a lot of experience by learning from each other.
