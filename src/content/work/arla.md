Our solution, designed for Arla, is intended for their farmers. This solution enables farmers to provide essential information about reducing CO2 in a user-friendly way. Furthermore, they can find interesting news that could assist them in achieving the CO2 goals set by Arla and track their progress.

## Main problem

The main problem was the lack of a solution for Arlaâ€™s farmers that would allow them to monitor their progress in reducing CO2. Since farmers had to fill out a long form about their progress from time to time, they had to be convinced to stay on the website after submitting a form.

## Style tiles

This time, we did not have to create our own design because the purpose was to follow Arla's CVI. In this case, we analyzed all the details in the document, chose elements that suit our solution the most, and prepared a style tile that we followed during the creation process.

## Mockups
The entire desktop-only solution has five essential pages:
- Home - dashboard
- News
- Data
- CO2 Form
- Profile

On the *Home* page, farmers can find basic information about their progress in reducing CO2 as a chart for better visualization, easy access to continue filling out the form about their progress, information on how many days are left to submit the form, and a brief weather report that they can expect during their work. Furthermore, they always have quick access to Arla's page with all the essential information about its Arla 2050 program.

On the following page, users can read news/articles provided by Arla. They are divided into five categories so that users can choose the most interesting one.
                
Another page is used for an overview of the users' data. For instance, there are statistics about their work and comparisons with previous months/years. Further down, all significant charts with data related to the Arla 2050 goal can be found. Thanks to that, farmers are kept updated on their hard work progress all the time.

The *Form* page is one of the most essential ones in the whole solution. This is where farmers can fill out the form about their work. To make it more understandable and easy to navigate, the whole form has been divided into four sections. Each section contains a specific number of questions that users have to answer. The most important feature of this form is that farmers can save their answers without submitting the form at any time. This feature allows them to split the work based on their preferences. In addition, an implemented progress bar keeps them updated on how far they are in the form.

Last but not least, the profile page contains simple settings options such as choosing a language, turning notifications and themes on/off. In terms of themes, our idea was to use colors from Arla's color palette that would represent each season and adjust the design's colors to this particular one, as well as the image on the *Home* page. Moreover, a rewarding system has been added to keep farmers using our solution. Based on their progress in reducing CO2, they will be rewarded by getting a new badge and increasing the milk price by 0.25 cents.

## Conclusions

It was a great experience creating a solution for such a big company like Arla. Thanks to this project, I was able to learn how to follow already existing design rules and style and how to make a solution consistent with any other ones so users will not have a feeling of using a completely different product provided by the same company.
