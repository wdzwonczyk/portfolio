The Arla project was a team effort, created for Arla farmers. This solution provides an easy way for farmers to share crucial information on reducing CO2 emissions. The project began with thorough research, including both desk research to understand the challenges farmers face in reducing emissions and field research, which featured a presentation by Arla representatives followed by a Q&A session. We also conducted usability testing to ensure the platform was effective and user-friendly. This helped us develop a practical and user-centered solution.

## Main problem

The main objective of this project was to support Arla's digitalization efforts by providing farmers with a solution to monitor their progress in reducing CO2 emissions. Arla sought to streamline the entire process to measure the progress in achieving their 2050 sustainability goals. The challenge lays in the fact that farmers typically had to complete extensive progress forms periodically. To ensure a successful transition to the digital platform, it was crucial to convince farmers not only to use the solution for submitting forms but also to engage more comprehensively with the website.

## Desk research - Personas

Throughout this project, we had the opportunity to collaborate with two distinctive user profiles provided by Arla for this initiative, namely Henry and Casper. Their participation was instrumental in gaining insights into the user landscape and shaping our solutions to suit their distinct preferences and needs.

One notable distinction between Henry and Casper is their level of technological expertise. It's important to emphasize that while we cannot reveal specific personal details, Casper stands out as a more tech-savvy user, while Henry has a relatively lower level of familiarity with digital interfaces. This difference in IT skills provided us with valuable insights that guided our approach to developing the platform.

By closely examining these personas, we could create a solution that seamlessly accommodated users across the IT proficiency spectrum. This approach ensured an inclusive and user-friendly experience for all. This project underscored the significance of customizing solutions to cater to specific user segments, all within the framework of user-centric design principles.

## Desk research - Sweetspot 

![Example of sweetspot that represents Arla project's research](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-research-sweetspots.jpg)

After conducting extensive research, it became evident that farmers were seeking seamless access to vital information, a means to track their progress in reducing carbon footprints, and a simplified form submission process. In parallel, the company aimed to minimize its carbon footprint, enhance the farmer experience, and work steadfastly towards its 2050 sustainability goals.

To address these requirements optimally, we pinpointed strategic areas within our research that allowed us to align our solution with the preferences of both farmers and the company. This approach facilitated the creation of a web application that not only enhanced convenience for farmers but also contributed significantly to Arla's progress towards achieving its 2050 sustainability objectives while consistently upholding eco-conscious principles.

## Desk research - Empathy Map 

This empathy map provides valuable insights into the user's goals, actions, thoughts, and feelings across various stages of their interaction with the platform. Understanding these user perspectives can guide design decisions and ensure that the platform aligns with their needs and expectations.

### Before (Awareness, Consideration):
**Goals:** Users in the Awareness and Consideration stages have a range of goals. They want to gain insights into their CO2 footprint and stay updated with the latest news. Access to their data and an overview of all Arla's farmers' data are essential. They aim to be aware of Arla's 2050 goals and track their progress and achievements.

**Actions:** During this phase, users are proactive. They gather data about their farms, seek assistance if needed, and personalize their platform by entering their farm ID. They also prepare to open and fill out the form.

**Thoughts and Feelings:** Users in the Before stages display a mixture of curiosity, interest, and hope. They are curious about the benefits they will gain, interested in learning and improving, and hopeful that the process will be straightforward. However, there's also a sense of stress and nervousness about the upcoming form.

### During (Selection, Registration):
**Goals:** Users during the Selection and Registration stages aim for efficient and effective interactions. They seek to view their data clearly and understandably, easily navigate the news, and find the form without much hassle. They desire a smooth form-filling experience that doesn't bore them and helps them improve their knowledge about farming.

**Actions:** In these stages, users focus on specific actions. They filter the news based on their interests, closely examine their data against Arla's farmers' data, understand their achievements, fill out the form, save their progress, and expect feedback during the form-filling process.

**Thoughts and Feelings:** During the Selection and Registration phases, users show positive and motivated thoughts and feelings. They're interested in exploring and improving, motivated to be better when they see results, informed, and pleasantly surprised by the ease of navigation and understanding of the form.

### After (Satisfaction, Loyalty, Advocacy):
**Goals:** After users have more experienced interactions, their goals shift. They want to improve their farm performance, compare their previous data, understand Arla's progress in the 2050 program, and see its relevance to them.

**Actions:** In the Satisfaction, Loyalty, and Advocacy phases, users engage in actions that reflect their satisfaction and loyalty. They use the rewards and goods obtained through achievements, use their data to enhance their financial situation, actively share their positive experiences with the platform, and expect to receive notifications about deadlines and news that interest them.

**Thoughts and Feelings:** Post-interaction, users feel satisfied with their results and are inspired to use the platform regularly. They are excited about the rewards and goods they earn, and this leads to an increased level of loyalty and advocacy.

## Desk research - User Journey 

To understand how our personas interact with the content we provide, we created user journeys for each of them. This approach helped us gain a deeper insight into their preferences, navigation patterns, and content interactions.


Upon examining both user journeys, it becomes evident that during the period when they are required to complete the form and submit it to Arla, their journeys align. They both proceed directly to the form page, complete the questionnaire, and submit it to Arla, then proceed to the data page. However, it is anticipated that Casper will dedicate more time to exploring the data page in greater detail compared to Henry.

Over the span of three months, both users revisit our solution to peruse news content and occasionally check the data. Both users share an interest in reading news, with Casper displaying a stronger inclination due to his desire for continuous learning about farming. Conversely, Henry seeks to stay informed about essential developments in the farming sector. As such, Casper is likely to frequent the data page more often than Henry, who is expected to access it just once after form submission.

The subsequent pages showcase the detailed user journeys for both personas.

## Usability Testing 

Usability tests was conducted with 2 farmers. During each testing, we managed to obtain valuable feedback that was both positive and constructive. This helped us gain a deeper understanding of the specific target group, as well as their sentiments toward our solution, its usage, and perception.

These tests were carried out online using lookback.io. To kick off, we provided an introduction to Arla's 2050 goal and defined the problem statement. Following this, participants were encouraged to explore the solution while expressing their thoughts aloud.

Also, a set of guiding questions were prepared for situations where participants were hesitant to voice their opinions or when we sought specific feedback.

The results of both tests can be found on the image below.

## Style tiles

This time, we did not have to create our own design because the purpose was to follow Arla's CVI. In this case, we analyzed all the details in the document, chose elements that suit our solution the most, and prepared a style tile that we followed during the creation process.

## Mockups
The entire desktop-only solution has five essential pages:
- Home - dashboard
- News
- Data
- CO2 Form
- Profile

On the *Home* page, farmers can find basic information about their progress in reducing CO2 as a chart for better visualization, easy access to continue filling out the form about their progress, information on how many days are left to submit the form, and a brief weather report that they can expect during their work. Furthermore, they always have quick access to Arla's page with all the essential information about its Arla 2050 program.

On the following page, users can read news/articles provided by Arla. They are divided into five categories so that users can choose the most interesting one.
                
Another page is used for an overview of the users' data. For instance, there are statistics about their work and comparisons with previous months/years. Further down, all significant charts with data related to the Arla 2050 goal can be found. Thanks to that, farmers are kept updated on their hard work progress all the time.

The *Form* page is one of the most essential ones in the whole solution. This is where farmers can fill out the form about their work. To make it more understandable and easy to navigate, the whole form has been divided into four sections. Each section contains a specific number of questions that users have to answer. The most important feature of this form is that farmers can save their answers without submitting the form at any time. This feature allows them to split the work based on their preferences. In addition, an implemented progress bar keeps them updated on how far they are in the form.

Last but not least, the profile page contains simple settings options such as choosing a language, turning notifications and themes on/off. In terms of themes, our idea was to use colors from Arla's color palette that would represent each season and adjust the design's colors to this particular one, as well as the image on the *Home* page. Moreover, a rewarding system has been added to keep farmers using our solution. Based on their progress in reducing CO2, they will be rewarded by getting a new badge and increasing the milk price by 0.25 cents.
