The Arla project was a team effort, created for Arla farmers. This solution provides an easy way for farmers to share crucial information on reducing CO2 emissions. The project aimed to aid Arla’s digitalization, offering farmers a tool to track CO2 reduction progress aligning with 2050 sustainability goals.

In the upcoming sections, I will provide a concise overview of our research methodology, the strategic steps taken, insightful results, and a glimpse into the development process, including design guides and detailed mockups.

## Challenge

Farmers, accustomed to periodic progress forms, posed a challenge in transitioning to a digital platform. Success hinged on persuading them to not just submit forms but engage extensively with the website.

Another challenging task was to create a product accessible to farmers of all ages and IT skills. To achieve this, we aimed for an easy-to-navigate UI that aligns with Arla’s design.

## Main idea

Our main goal was to create a product accessible to farmers of all ages and IT skills. To achieve this, we aimed for an easy-to-navigate UI that aligns with Arla's design. Beyond just serving as a platform for submitting CO2 data, we wanted to encourage prolonged engagement. Hence, we incorporated information and resources about farming and agricultural technology. Additionally, we introduced gamification elements to enhance user retention.

## Research Methodology

### Personas
We collaborated with two user profiles provided by Arla: Henry and Casper. Their participation was instrumental in gaining insights into the user landscape and shaping our solutions to suit their distinct preferences and needs. Casper, a tech-savvy user, and Henry, with lower familiarity with digital interfaces, provided valuable insights that guided our approach to developing the platform. This approach ensured an inclusive and user-friendly experience for all.

### Sweetspot 
Our research highlighted that farmers sought seamless access to vital information, a means to track their progress in reducing carbon footprints, and a simplified form submission process. In parallel, Arla aimed to minimize its carbon footprint, enhance the farmer experience, and work towards its 2050 sustainability goals. Aligning our solution with these preferences facilitated the creation of a web application that not only enhanced convenience for farmers but also contributed to Arla’s sustainability objectives.

### Empathy Map 
This empathy map provided insights into the user’s goals, actions, thoughts, and feelings across various stages of their interaction with the platform. Understanding these perspectives guided design decisions, ensuring alignment with user needs and expectations.

### User Journey 
We created user journeys for each persona to understand their interactions with the platform. This approach revealed that both personas followed similar paths during form submission but differed in their engagement levels with other content. Casper explored data pages more frequently, while Henry focused on essential updates.

### Usability Testing 
Conducted with two farmers using lookback.io, usability tests provided valuable feedback. These tests included an introduction to Arla’s 2050 goal, exploration of the solution, and a set of guiding questions. The results offered deeper insights into the target group and their sentiments towards the solution.

The results of both tests can be found on the image below.

## Solution

To achieve our goals, we aimed for an easy-to-navigate UI that aligns with Arla's design. Beyond serving as a platform for submitting CO2 data, we wanted to encourage prolonged engagement. Hence, we incorporated information and resources about farming and agricultural technology. Additionally, we introduced gamification elements to enhance user retention.

## Style tiles

Following Arla’s CVI, we analyzed the details in the document, selected elements that suited our solution, and prepared a style tile to guide the creation process.

## Mockups

![Example of mockups that represents Arla CO2 platform](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-mockups.jpg)

The entire desktop-only solution comprises five essential pages:

![Example of Home page mockups that represents Arla CO2 platform](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-mockups-home.jpg)

- **Home - Dashboard**: Displays basic information about CO2 reduction progress with charts, form access, submission deadlines, weather reports, and quick access to Arla’s 2050 program information.

![Example of News page mockups that represents Arla CO2 platform](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-mockups-news.jpg)

- **News**: Features articles provided by Arla, divided into five categories for easy navigation.

![Example of Data page mockups that represents Arla CO2 platform](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-mockups-data.jpg)                
              
- **Data**: Provides an overview of user data, statistics, comparisons with previous periods, and significant charts related to the 2050 goal.

![Example of Form page mockups that represents Arla CO2 platform](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-mockups-form.jpg)

- **CO2 Form**: Divided into four sections with a progress bar, allowing farmers to save answers and complete the form at their convenience.

![Example of Profile page mockups that represents Arla CO2 platform](/portfolio/assets/arla/arla-mockups-profile.jpg)

- **Profile**: Contains settings for language, notifications, and themes, along with a rewarding system based on CO2 reduction progress Moreover, a rewarding system has been added to keep farmers using our solution. Based on their progress in reducing CO2, they will be rewarded by getting a new badge and increasing the milk price by 0.25 cents.

## Conclusions

Working on this project was a valuable experience, allowing me to gain insights into adhering to company design guidelines and styles. I enhanced my expertise in conducting desk research and usability testing with end-users. This project underscored the importance of user-centered design principles and provided valuable insights for future projects, ensuring a great user experience.
