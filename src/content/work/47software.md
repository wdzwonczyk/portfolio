The 47software website presents a modern software house based in Poland that specializes in delivering full-stack digital solutions, including mobile and web applications, API development, and systems integration. My task was to design a website that not only highlights the team’s technical skills but also reflects their identity as a reliable and innovative partner in the digital space.

In this case study, I’ll walk you through my design decisions—starting from the research phase to building a custom UI kit and creating engaging mockups that emphasize the company’s capabilities and personality. Special attention was given to crafting a visually appealing experience enriched with thoughtful details and subtle animations.

## The challenge

The main challenge was to create a website that showcases 47software’s range of services and technical expertise while staying true to their identity as a creative, modern, and trustworthy software house.

## Research
To ensure the final design reflects both user expectations and 47software’s unique identity, I conducted a short yet focused research phase:

- **Competitor Analysis** - reviewed websites of other software houses to identify common patterns, strong practices, and potential gaps.
- **Stakeholder Interviews** - gained insights into 47software’s values, offerings, and what differentiates them from competitors.
- **User Behavior Insights** - analyzed how potential clients browse tech service websites to define the most important content and user flows.

### Key Findings & Impact on Design:
- **Users look for credibility through real projects and expertise** - added a dedicated Projects page and Blog to build trust through case studies, industry insights, and technology highlights.
- **Clarity and simplicity in content help engage both tech and non-tech visitors** - used concise language and a clear layout across the Home, Services, and Case Study pages to support easy navigation and understanding.
- **Modern visuals and subtle animations enhance brand perception** - integrated clean design with thoughtful micro-interactions and animations to reflect 47software’s innovation and attention to detail.
- **Users want quick access to get in touch or estimate a project** - placed a visible “Estimate Project” CTA in the navigation to encourage conversions and streamline contact.

These insights guided every design decision — from layout and visuals to the type of interactions — resulting in a website that feels both professional and engaging for a wide range of users.

## Design Foundation – UI Kit

The entire design was based on a custom-built UI Kit, crafted to maintain visual consistency and simplify development. It served as a single source of truth for both designers and developers, enabling smooth scalability in future stages.

By employing a thoughtfully crafted UI kit, this project achieved not only a faster design process but also a more streamlined development phase, ensuring a delightful user experience for both visitors and the developer responsible for bringing the design to life.

## Mockups
