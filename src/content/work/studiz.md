The Studiz is not only a company name but also its flagship solution, mobile app prepared for students to make their life easier and cheaper. In the app, users can find hundreds of attractive discounts that will allow them to save some money. Besides discounts, the app has following features such as digital Student ID used for identification, Canteen system, Library system and much more.<br><br>

## Design system, Pattern Library and Style Guide

The main goal of my work was to redesign a mobile app and desktop web app. To accomplish this in the most effective way, I created a Design System that could enable the company to work more efficiently. Based on my previous job experience and knowledge gained during my free time, I created a brand new system from scratch, which allowed me to keep all design rules, such as colors and typography, with a description of when and how to use them. The system also includes the whole components library and views in one place.

Thanks to the Design System, Studiz company and its developers now have a source of truth regarding mobile app/web app design rules and components that can be followed by them anytime. For designers, they can now maintain design consistency throughout all Studiz solutions.

## Before and after

I completely redesigned the mobile app with the main goal of not only creating a new, fresh look for the app but also improving the UX flow to make it more intuitive and straightforward.

Currently, the main emphasis is on the *Campaign* section, which contains temporary special deals that are most profitable for students. Thanks to the use of different colors, users can easily scan them without reading the text and figure out which ones can help them save the most money. Another part is the *Favourites* section, which shows information about new discounts in these particular web shops. The last section is a slider with all regular discounts categories, which is placed on the bottom of the screen for easy access.

Regarding discount details, I kept the “discount/voucher/ticket” look, so that users would immediately recognize what it is.

There are also many other details that cannot be seen in the images, such as the search function, animations, and specific zooming map features. All of these elements have been presented as various prototypes so that developers can have a look and implement them into the exact solution.<br><br>

When it comes to the discount provider, there is a slider that contains all discounts and another item with the provider's information. To improve the flow, I created a one-page layout divided into segments with two sections: discounts and information. This allows users to easily switch between them at any time. All available discounts, including campaigns and regular ones, are grouped in the discounts section. Additionally, users can check provider information without having to slide to the last item.<br><br>

## Conclusions

Working on Studiz cases helped me develop my design skills, gain new ones, and increase my confidence in making decisions that had an impact on the solutions’ future. Working with other developers and designers improved my team working skills. I learned how to organize workflows for better communication with them and make the whole process smoother and more transparent.
