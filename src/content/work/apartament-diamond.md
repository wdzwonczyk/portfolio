The Apartament Diamond website showcases a stylish rental apartment located by the Baltic Sea in Poland. My task was to create an elegant and modern representation of the space while ensuring easy communication with the owner. The apartment's key features include its prime location, a spacious balcony, and a tastefully modern interior. The website includes essential pages like Home, About, Gallery, Prices, Blog, and Contact, offering a seamless user experience for potential renters to explore and connect.

## Main Idea

The main idea behind this project was to create a luxurious and modern design for a seaside apartment located next to the beach. The carefully selected color scheme played a pivotal role in achieving this vision.

For the primary color, *#C89779* was chosen to represent the essence of the coastal setting. This warm and inviting tone exudes the natural charm of the seaside, evoking feelings of relaxation and tranquility. By incorporating this color, the design instantly establishes a strong connection to the apartment's breathtaking location by the beach.

In contrast, the deep and sophisticated *#36373C* was employed to add a touch of elegance and modernity. This rich, dark hue imbues the design with a sense of luxury, evoking a refined ambiance that complements the upscale nature of the apartment.

As for the neutral color *#FFF* (white), it was intentionally incorporated to bring a sense of purity and freshness to the overall aesthetic. White acts as a canvas that allows the other colors to shine, enhancing the minimalist approach of the design while ensuring a clean and timeless appearance.

The typography choices of *Playfair Display* for headings and titles, and *Lato* for regular text further reinforce the luxurious yet minimalist theme. *Playfair Display* boasts a classic and sophisticated look, elevating headings and titles with a touch of elegance. On the other hand, *Lato* offers clear legibility and a contemporary feel, ensuring a smooth reading experience for regular text content.

By thoughtfully combining these elements, the design achieves a harmonious blend of luxury, modernity, and minimalism. The color palette captures the coastal allure of the apartment, while the chosen typography lends a sense of sophistication and readability to the entire user experience. The end result is a visually captivating and immersive design that perfectly reflects the unique charm and refined ambiance of the seaside apartment.

## Design System

The entire solution was built on a custom-made Design System, which served as the foundation for the project. I chose this approach not only because it has become a standard practice in the industry, streamlining the mockup creation process, but also with the developer in mind. By following the Design System, I aimed to facilitate the coding process for the developer, ensuring a smoother and more efficient workflow.

The Design System is structured into two main files: *Foundation* and *Components*. In the *Foundation* file, you'll find comprehensive information about the color palette, complete with detailed naming conventions that indicate where each color should be utilized. Additionally, the typography guidelines are included to maintain a consistent and cohesive visual language throughout the project.

To implement these design elements seamlessly, I grouped all colors and typography settings, creating dedicated Figma Design System Styles. This enabled easy access and ensured consistent application of colors and typography across the entire project. To get a better understanding of the Design System in action, I provided visual examples in the image below, showcasing how the styles are utilized to maintain a harmonious user interface.

As for the *Components* file, it organizes various elements based on their type, such as buttons, breadcrumbs, cards, and more. This meticulous categorization ensures that components are easily accessible and can be efficiently implemented in both desktop and mobile versions of the project. The goal was to create a cohesive and user-friendly interface that remains visually appealing and consistent, irrespective of the device being used.

By employing a thoughtfully crafted Design System, this project achieved not only a faster design process but also a more streamlined development phase, ensuring a delightful user experience for both visitors and the developer responsible for bringing the design to life.

## Mockups

The *Home Page* serves as a captivating preview, offering users a glimpse of each section's content. Within this page, users can immediately access relevant information about the apartment, including a description of the location, a selection of images showcasing the space, and the apartment layout, complete with key details such as room count and square footage of both the apartment and balcony. By providing this essential information upfront, users can make informed decisions without the need to click through multiple pages. For those seeking more in-depth details, the *See more* option is available, guiding them to explore further.

Additionally, the *Home page* features a dedicated section displaying prices and testimonials from previous renters, establishing credibility and trustworthiness. The page culminates with a compelling Call-to-Action (CTA) container, encouraging visitors to reach out and connect with the owner should they find the apartment appealing.

On the *About page*, users are offered a deeper understanding of the destination they are considering for their stay. Building upon the information presented on the *Home Page*, this section provides comprehensive details about the area's attractions, amenities, and the apartment's equipment. This ensures that users have a comprehensive overview before making any decisions, enhancing their confidence in the rental choice.

Moving on to the *Gallery page*, it serves as an engaging visual showcase of the apartment's interior. To enhance user-friendliness, I implemented room type filters, enabling users to view specific areas of interest without the need to scroll through an extensive image collection. This thoughtful approach streamlines the browsing experience, allowing users to focus solely on what intrigues them the most.

The *Blog page* presents a treasure trove of articles and news about the apartment, the city, nearby attractions, and more. Not only does this enrich users' experience with valuable insights, but it also contributes to elevating the website's search engine visibility. By optimizing content for search engines, the website gains an advantage in Google Search Results, ultimately attracting more potential renters and fostering engagement.

Lastly, the *Contact page* accommodates users who wish to get in touch with the owner. Since a booking system was not implemented at this stage, I devised a user-friendly form that provides essential information for the owner. Submissions via this form generate a direct email to the potential customer, facilitating seamless communication. Alternatively, users have the option to contact the owner via a phone call, ensuring multiple channels for easy access and efficient interactions.

By thoughtfully designing each page and considering the user's perspective, this website provides an immersive experience, encouraging users to explore and connect with the apartment, while meeting the owner's goals for effective communication and potential future expansion.

## Conclusions

Working on this project was a valuable experience that allowed me to improve my skills in creating a comprehensive Design System for designers and developers. Adhering to specific style and tone requirements sparked my creativity, inspiring me to explore and discover new design styles that perfectly fit the project's vision.

Throughout the process, I enjoyed this creative journey, learning and refining my UX/UI design skills. This project had a meaningful impact on my professional growth, providing valuable insights to approach future projects with creativity and thoughtfulness, ensuring a great user experience. I'm excited to apply these skills and knowledge to enhance future projects even more.
