The Apartament Diamond website showcases a stylish rental apartment located by the Baltic Sea in Poland. My task was to create an elegant and modern representation of the space while ensuring easy communication with the owner. The apartment’s key features include its prime location, a spacious balcony, and a tastefully modern interior.

In this case study, I’ll explore the details of my design decisions, including colors and typography. I’ll also share information about creating a solid design system as a source of truth for designers and developers, ensuring it’s scalable for future development.

## The challenge

The challenge was to create a website that would present all the apartment's benefits and convince users to stay in the apartment by the seaside.

## Design choices

**Color Foundation**:

- **Primary Color (#C89779)**: Chosen to represent the essence of the coastal setting. This warm and inviting tone exudes the natural charm of the seaside, evoking feelings of relaxation and tranquility.
- **Accent Color (#36373C)**: Used to add a touch of elegance and modernity. This rich, dark hue imbues the design with a sense of luxury, evoking a refined ambiance that complements the upscale nature of the apartment.
- **Neutral Color (#FFF)**: Incorporated to bring a sense of purity and freshness to the overall aesthetic. White acts as a canvas that allows other colors to shine, enhancing the minimalist approach of the design while ensuring a clean and timeless appearance.

**Typography Foundation**:

- **Playfair Display**: Used for headings and titles, it boasts a classic and sophisticated look, elevating the design with a touch of elegance.
- **Lato**: Selected for regular text, it offers clear legibility and a contemporary feel, ensuring a smooth reading experience.

By thoughtfully combining these elements, the design achieves a harmonious blend of luxury, modernity, and minimalism. The color palette captures the coastal allure of the apartment, while the chosen typography lends a sense of sophistication and readability to the entire user experience. The result is a visually captivating and immersive design that perfectly reflects the unique charm and refined ambiance of the seaside apartment.

## Design System

The entire solution was built on a custom-made Design System, which served as the foundation for the project. This approach ensured a smoother and more efficient workflow for designer and scalability for future development.

**Foundation**:

- **Color Palette**: Detailed naming conventions indicating where each color should be utilized.
- **Typography Guidelines**: Maintaining a consistent visual language throughout the project.

**Components**:

- **Component Library**: Organized elements like buttons, breadcrumbs, and cards based on their type. This categorization ensured that components were easily accessible and efficiently implemented in both desktop and mobile versions of the project.

By employing a thoughtfully crafted Design System, this project achieved not only a faster design process but also a more streamlined development phase, ensuring a delightful user experience for both visitors and the developer responsible for bringing the design to life.
